## Description

Module01 explores the aspect of accessibility for web development and the idea
of refractoring existing code. The code is refractored so that it uses semantic
HTML elements, makes sure that iamges have alternate attributes, improving the
title element, making sure that the HTML elements follow a logical structure,
and that the heading elements are in sequential order.
